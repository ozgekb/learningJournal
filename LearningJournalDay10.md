when our code is run order of execution is important
memory is using  Call Stack to order of execution.
If code can have syntax errors, referance errors, type errors,
if errors raised , program stops there.We can see the  call stack form the consol where the errors occurs.
If we have errors , we use try catch
debugger; stops our code and we could figure out what is happening in the code.
we can resume or step over.
From console sources tab shows local and global values.
console.log has some variation like console.table we can debug with literal object
