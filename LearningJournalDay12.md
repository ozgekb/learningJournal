Today day12 and we did code review which was very informative. Than we learned how to create a chart with javascript.

canvas tag is a html tag. we use this to create chart
it is not a self closing tag
we can create rectangle and fill
we can style it. It is really hard to draw with canvas
we can use   chart.js library
