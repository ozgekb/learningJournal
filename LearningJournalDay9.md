Today we did some code review which was very useful for me. Then we learn some css code.After that, we design calculator.Here is what I learn :

we can change list items with
list-style-type: none;
list-style-position :inside  made it content tab
we can use padding to seperate table columns inside table  |
border-spacing also does the same thing
border-collapse : collapse make it together
text-transform:
letter-spacing
empty cells we can show or hide them empty-cell:hide
we can style input field , we can change background color, text color
background-repeat : no repeat ,
input#submit {} we can style submit button also
  <fieldset><legents><legents><fieldset>
  we can change the cursor  
  cursor:col-resze
